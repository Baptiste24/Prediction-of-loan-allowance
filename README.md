# Prediction-of-loan-allowance
We compare a random forest model and neural network in an imbalance classification problem on loan allowance

We handle the data by converting them to suitable format like boolean, we do this as well for the qualitative variable like gender. To do this we use OneHotEncoder.
We solve the imbalance of our data with a SMOTE algorithm.

Lastly we comment briefly on the compared results of neural network and random forest.

Please refer to the attached jupyter notebook.
